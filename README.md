# Internship-NTNU

This project implements a complete pipeline for decoding motor imagery EEG signals to control a drone in real time. It is structured around three key components:
• EEG acquisition, preprocessing, and classification
• A modular and scalable software architecture
• Integration with a real drone and development of complementary tools (simulator, user guide)

The work addresses challenges across signal processing, robotics, and hardware-related real-time constraints. It provides a strong foundation for future improvements such as 3D control capabilities, enhanced algorithms, and multi-user EEG dataset sharing.
